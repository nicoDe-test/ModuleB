# ModuleB Module

This is the initial readme file for the *ModuleB Module* generated by ApiOmat. 
Feel free to update and adjust it to your needs.

A good starting point on how to write modules in ApiOmat would be the 

[official documentation pages](https://docs.apiomat.com/33/Create-your-own.html) 

and the

[example file](snippets.md)

included in this module root.
